In Easter 2025, [GuessBridge](https://guessbridge.co.uk/) was released. Whilst fun and perfect for procrastinating revision, the game limits you to 4 locations per day. Furthermore, the locations would sometimes be >10 m out (I'm assuming due to using the GPS in the photos' metadata), making it difficult to beat those clearly cheating (looking at you SamW and Splasha's Brother).

And so, introducing GuessBridge Unlimited: allowing unlimited plays and manually adjusted GPS coordinates to ensure accurate guessing!

I even bought the domain...
