I recently acquired the Lego NASA Apollo 11 Lunar Lander (10266) which made a fine addition to my space collection, joining the Apollo 11 Saturn V, Space Shuttle Discovery, Hubble Space Telescope, International Space Station, and Lego's own Space Shuttle Adventure.

Having previously enjoyed film making with Lego, I wished to film a moon landing sequence with my new moon lander. As those who have made any short film will know, the audio and music can make or break a sequence. I am no audio/music expert, and therefore I turned to the film, First Man, to provide suitable audio and music, as well as scene direction.
